{{Client function}}
This function gets the owner of a [[Element/Weapon|custom weapon]]. Weapon ownership system was, however, disabled, so this function always returns ''false''. Please refer to [[setWeaponOwner]] for details.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool getWeaponOwner ( weapon theWeapon )</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP|Pair is completely disabled at the moment (its value is ''[[nil]]'').|[[Element/Weapon|weapon]]:getOwner|owner|setWeaponOwner}}

===Required Arguments===
* '''theWeapon:''' The weapon to get the owner of.

===Returns===
This function was intended to return the [[player]] which owns the [[Element/Weapon|custom weapon]], and ''false'' if an error occured. However, at the moment it always returns ''false''.

==Example==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function arma()
	minigun = createWeapon("minigun", 1, 1, 3)--Create the weapon
	setWeaponClipAmmo(minigun, 99999)
        setWeaponState(minigun, "firing")
	setWeaponProperty(minigun, "fire_rotation", 0, -30, 0)
	dueno = getWeaponOwner(minigun)--This gets the owner
	outputChatBox(tostring(dueno))--And this say it in the chatbox
end
