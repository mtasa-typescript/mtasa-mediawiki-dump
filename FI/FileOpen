{{Server client function}}
Opens an existing file for reading and writing.
{{Note|To prevent memory leaks, ensure each successful call to [[fileOpen]] has a matching call to [[fileClose]].}}
{{Tip|The file functions should not be used to implement configuration files. It is encouraged to use the XML functions for this instead.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
file fileOpen ( string filePath [, bool readOnly = false ])
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP|The function will only attempt to open the file, it won't create it.|[[File]]}}

{{New feature/item|9.0156|1.5.6|11865|
{{OOP|This is a static function underneath the File class. Using '''File(...)''' to open a file will attempt to create the file, if it doesn't exist|[[File]].open}}
}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''filePath:''' The [[filepath]] of the file in the following format: '''":resourceName/path"'''. 'resourceName' is the name of the resource the file is in, and 'path' is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file.
:For example, if there is a file named 'coolObjects.txt' in the resource 'objectSearch', it can be opened from another resource this way: ''fileOpen(":objectSearch/coolObjects.txt")''.
:If the file is in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. ''fileOpen("coolObjects.txt")''.

===Optional Arguments===
*'''readOnly:''' By default, the file is opened with reading and writing access. You can specify ''true'' for this parameter if you only need reading access.

===Returns===
If successful, returns a file handle for the file. Otherwise returns ''false'' (f.e. if the file doesn't exist).

==Example==
This example opens the file test.txt that is in the root of the current resource, and outputs its contents to the console.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local hFile = fileOpen("test.txt", true)       -- attempt to open the file (read only)
if hFile then                                  -- check if it was successfully opened
    local buffer
    while not fileIsEOF(hFile) do              -- as long as we're not at the end of the file...
        buffer = fileRead(hFile, 500)          -- ... read the next 500 bytes...
        outputConsole(buffer)                  -- ... and output them to the console
    end
    fileClose(hFile)                           -- close the file once we're done with it
else
    outputConsole("Unable to open test.txt")
end
</syntaxhighlight>

This example show how to append data to an existing file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local hFile = fileOpen("test.txt")             -- attempt to open the file (read and write mode)
if hFile then                                  -- check if it was successfully opened
    fileSetPos( hFile, fileGetSize( hFile ) )  -- move position to the end of the file
    fileWrite(hFile, "hello" )                 -- append data
    fileFlush(hFile)                           -- Flush the appended data into the file.
    fileClose(hFile)                           -- close the file once we're done with it
else
    outputConsole("Unable to open test.txt")
end
