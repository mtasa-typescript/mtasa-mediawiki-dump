{{New feature/item|3.0160|1.5.8|20740|This function makes a [[ped]] enter a [[vehicle]], similar to the enter_exit control state.}}

{{Note|For this function to work on peds, the server and all clients are required to be on version '''1.5.8 r20740''' or newer.}}
{{Note|This function only works on synced peds and vehicles (ie. created serverside).}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setPedEnterVehicle ( ped thePed [, vehicle theVehicle = nil, bool passenger = false ] )
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePed:''' The [[player]] or [[ped]] to enter the vehicle.
**''Note: The player must be the local player.''
**''Note: The ped must be synced by the client. Use [[isElementSyncer]] clientside to check if the client is syncing. Use [[setElementSyncer]] serverside to change the syncer manually.''
*'''vehicle:''' The [[vehicle]] to enter. If no vehicle is set, the ped will enter the nearest vehicle within 20 m.
*'''passenger:''' If set to ''true'', the ped will enter as passenger in the nearest available seat, otherwise he will enter as driver.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the function was successful, ''false'' otherwise.

When this function returns ''true'', the client will ask server for permission to enter a vehicle. Actually entering can still fail in the following cases
*The function is used on a ped, but another client is not on version '''1.5.8 r20740''' or newer.
*Another player or ped is already entering, exiting or jacking the same vehicle and seat.
*Movement input or damage can interrupt the task. Use [[getPedTask]] to monitor what the ped is doing.

This function returns ''false'' in the following cases
*Invalid arguments were parsed.
*The function is used on a ped, but the server is not on version '''1.5.8 r20740''' or newer.
*Time passed since last enter/exit for this ped is less than 1500 ms.
*[[onClientVehicleStartEnter]] was cancelled by a script.
*The ped has an active TASK_PRIMARY [[task]]. Use [[getPedTask]] to monitor what the ped is doing.

==Example== 
Make ped Sweet enter his car
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local sweet = createPed(270, 0, 0, 3)
setElementID(sweet , 'sweet')

local sweets_car = createVehicle(492, 3, 0, 3)
setElementID(sweets_car, 'sweets_car')
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>

<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- Code works only if client is syncing ped Sweet
addCommandHandler('sweet_enter_car',
function()
    local sweet = getElementByID('sweet')

    if isElementSyncer(sweet) then
        setPedEnterVehicle(sweet, getElementByID('sweets_car'), true)
    end
end)
</syntaxhighlight>
