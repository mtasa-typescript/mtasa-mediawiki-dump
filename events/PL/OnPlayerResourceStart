{{Added feature/item|1.5.9|1.5.8|20957|This event is triggered when a [[resource]] has loaded client-side for a [[player]].}}
__NOTOC__
==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource loadedResource
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''loadedResource''': The [[resource]] that was loaded on the client.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[player]] who loaded the resource.

==Example==
This example shows how you can trigger a custom event client-side defined in the same resource as soon as the player is ready (resource loaded on client):
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler("onPlayerResourceStart", root, function(loadedResource)
	outputChatBox(getResourceName(loadedResource) .. " started for " .. getPlayerName(source))

	-- Trigger a custom clientside event defined in this resource
	if (getResourceRootElement(loadedResource) == resourceRoot) then
		triggerClientEvent(source, "onClientCustomEvent", resourceRoot) 
	end
end)
</syntaxhighlight>
