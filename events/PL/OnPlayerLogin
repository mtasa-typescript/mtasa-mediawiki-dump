__NOTOC__ 
This event is triggered when a player logs into their account in-game.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
account thePreviousAccount, account theCurrentAccount
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''thePreviousAccount''': the [[account]] the player was logged into before.
*'''theCurrentAccount''': the [[account]] the player logged into just now.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the player [[element]] that just logged in.

==Cancel effect==
If this event is canceled the player will not be logged in.

==Example== 
This example just outputs to the player console that a player in one account logged into an another account:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- root = getElementRoot()
addEventHandler("onPlayerLogin", root,
  function()
    outputChatBox(getPlayerName(source).." has logged in!", root)
  end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
This example allows only hardcoded serials to access given accounts.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
Firewall = 
{
--  [ 'accountName' ] = 'playerSerial',
    [ '3ash8' ] = '9C9F3B55D9D7BB7135FF274D3BF444E4',
    [ 'test5' ] = '1D6F76CF8D7193792D13789849498452',
}
 
addEventHandler ( 'onPlayerLogin', getRootElement ( ),
    function ( _, theCurrentAccount )
    local Serial = Firewall[getAccountName(theCurrentAccount)]
        if Serial and Serial ~= getPlayerSerial ( source ) then
            outputChatBox( "Sorry, you're not allowed to access this account.", source)
            cancelEvent( true )
        end
    end
)
