{{New feature/item|3|1.0||<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int totalAmmo, element killer, int killerWeapon, int bodypart, bool stealth
</syntaxhighlight>}}

{{Deprecated_feature|3|1.0|<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int totalAmmo, element killer, int killerWeapon, int bodypart
</syntaxhighlight>}}

*'''totalAmmo''': an [[int]] representing the total ammo the victim had when they died.
*'''killer''': an [[element]] representing the [[player]], [[ped]], [[vehicle]] or [[object]] who was the killer. Deaths resulting from fall damage provide the [[vehicle]] or [[object]] landed on as the killer. If there is no killer this is ''false''.
*'''killerWeapon''': an [[int]] representing the [[Weapons|killer weapon]] or the [[Damage Types|damage type]].
*'''bodypart''': an [[int]] representing the bodypart ID the victim was hit on when they died.
{{BodyParts}}
*'''stealth''': a [[boolean]] value representing whether or not this was a stealth kill.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[player]] that died or got killed.

==Example== 
This example prints the killer and bodypart to the chat when a player dies.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- register player_Wasted as a handler for onPlayerWasted
function player_Wasted ( ammo, attacker, weapon, bodypart )
	-- if there was an attacker
	if ( attacker ) then
		-- we declare our variable outside the following checks
		local tempString
		-- if the element that killed him was a player,
		if ( getElementType ( attacker ) == "player" ) then
			-- put the attacker, victim and weapon info in the string
			tempString = getPlayerName ( attacker ).." killed "..getPlayerName ( source ).." ("..getWeaponNameFromID ( weapon )..")"
		-- else, if it was a vehicle,

	end
end
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerWasted", root, player_Wasted )

And another example, this will spawn you in the middle of GTA SA world (x=0, y=0, z=3) after 2 seconds of your death
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onPlayerWasted", root,
	function()
		setTimer( spawnPlayer, 2000, 1, source, 0, 0, 3 )
	end
)
