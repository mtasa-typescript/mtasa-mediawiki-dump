__NOTOC__
{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when a player sends a private message with ''msg'' command.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
string message, player recipient
</syntaxhighlight> 
*'''message''': a [[string]] representing the private message to be sent.
*'''recipient''': the [[player]] to whom the message is being sent.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[player]] who sent the private message.

==Cancel effect==
If this event is [[Event system#Canceling|canceled]], the game's chat system won't deliver the message. You may use [[outputChatBox]] to send the messages then.

==Example== 
This example blocks players sending a PM to a player named "Bob".
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function blockPM(msg,r)
	if (getPlayerName(r) == "Bob") then -- If they sent a PM to "Bob"
		cancelEvent() -- Then cancel it
		outputChatBox("Bob is not accepting PM's at this time.",source,255,0,0) -- And output it was cancelled.
	end
end
addEventHandler("onPlayerPrivateMessage",root,blockPM)
</syntaxhighlight>
