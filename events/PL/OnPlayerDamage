__NOTOC__ 
{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when a player is damaged, in any way.

*This event is not triggered when attacked by a team member if friendly fire is enabled.
*Canceling this event has no effect. Cancel the client-side event [[onClientPlayerDamage]] instead.
*onPlayerDamage doesn't trigger if the damage kills the player, [[onPlayerWasted]] is called instead. 

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
player attacker, int damage_causing, int bodypart, float loss
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''attacker''': a [[player]] element representing the player who was the attacker.  If there was no attacker this returns false.
*'''damage_causing''': an [[int]] representing the cause of damage, either a [[Weapons|attacker weapon]], or some other [[Damage Types|types of damage]].
*'''bodypart''': an [[int]] representing the bodypart ID the player was hit on when he got damaged.
{{BodyParts}}
*'''loss''': a [[float]] representing the percentage of health the player lost.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[player]] who was damaged.

==Example== 
This example causes an instant kill when a player is shot in the head, and announces it in the chatbox.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function playerDamage_text ( attacker, weapon, bodypart, loss ) --when a player is damaged
	if ( bodypart == 9 and attacker and attacker ~= source ) then -- if the body part is 9 (head) and there is an attacker and it wasn't self damage
            outputChatBox ( "Headshot!", attacker, 255, 170, 0 ) --output "Headshot" into the chatbox
	    killPed ( source, attacker, weapon, bodypart ) -- and kill the player
	end
end
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerDamage", root, playerDamage_text ) --add an event handler for the onPlayerDamage event
</syntaxhighlight>
