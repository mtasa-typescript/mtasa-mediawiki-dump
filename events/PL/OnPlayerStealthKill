<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
element targetPlayer
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''targetPlayer''': the [[player]] or [[ped]] that is being stealth killed.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[player]] that initiated the stealth kill.

==Cancel effect==
If this event is [[Event system#Canceling|canceled]], then the stealth kill is aborted.

==Example== 
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function onStealthKill(targetPlayer)
     outputChatBox("Stealth kill!", source) -- Tell the player he/she has done a stealth kill.
     outputChatBox("" .. getPlayerName(targetPlayer) .. " has been stealth-killed by " .. getPlayerName(source) .. ".")
end
addEventHandler("onPlayerStealthKill", getRootElement(), onStealthKill) -- Adds a handler for the stealth kill event.
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>


<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function onStealthKill(targetPlayer)
     cancelEvent(true, "No more stealth kills.") -- Aborts the stealth-kill.
end
addEventHandler("onPlayerStealthKill", getRootElement(), onStealthKill) -- Adds a handler for the stealth kill event.

This example will prevent the stealthkill animation of the attacker as it occurs, something which is tricky to achieve (hence this example is extra useful).
Note: you won't get this to work properly without timer and 'fake' animation. Lots of scripters have broken their backs over this.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onPlayerStealthKill", getRootElement(),
    function(targetPlayer)
            setTimer(
                function(thePlayer)
                    setPedAnimation(thePlayer, "ped", "0", -1, true, true, true, true, 350)
                end, 50, 1, source
            )
    end
)
