__NOTOC__
{{Client event}}
This event is triggered when a sound has just finished downloading. This means the complete sound file is now loaded in the player's RAM, and can be played completely from start to end. Unlike [[onClientSoundStream]], this event only triggers for file streams, not for live ones since live streams never actually end.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int length
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''length''': The length of the stream in milliseconds

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[sound]] which just finished downloading.

==Example== 
This example would output to the chatbox after the sound is finish that the sound has finished downloading in ... milliseconds.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">addEventHandler("onClientSoundFinishedDownload",root,function(length)
	local meta = getSoundMetaTags(source)
	outputChatBox("The sound: "..(meta.title).." has finished in :"..length.."ms.")
end)
</syntaxhighlight>
