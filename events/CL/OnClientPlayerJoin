{{Client event}}
This event is triggered when a [[player]] joins a server. It is triggered for all players except the local player, as the local player joins the server before their client-side resources are started. It would also be possible for two players to join within a few seconds of each other and for the two players' scripts may not receive onClientPlayerJoin events as their scripts wouldn't have started yet.

This event is not cancellable.

==Parameters==
''None''

==Source==

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">

end
addEventHandler("onClientPlayerJoin", getRootElement(), remotePlayerJoin)
</syntaxhighlight>
