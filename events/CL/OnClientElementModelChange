{{New feature/item|3.0157|1.5.6|16404|This event is triggered when the model of an [[element]] is changed using [[setElementModel]].}}

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int oldModel, int newModel
</syntaxhighlight> 

* '''oldModel:''' an [[int]] representing the model of the [[element]] before the change occurred.
* '''newModel:''' an [[int]] representing the new model of the [[element]].

==Source==
The source of this event is the element that changed its model.

==Cancel effect==
This event doesn't support [[Event system#Canceling|cancellation]]. Use [[setElementModel]] with the old value to reverse.

==Example== 
This example sends a message to players when their model changes telling them what the model ID is and was.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function informPlayerOnModelChange(oldModel, newModel)
    if ( getElementType(source) == "player" ) then -- Make sure the element is a player
        outputChatBox("Model ID changing from: "..oldModel.." to: ".. newModel, 0, 255, 0) -- Message for player
    end
end
addEventHandler("onClientElementModelChange", root, informPlayerOnModelChange) -- Bind the event to every element
</syntaxhighlight>
