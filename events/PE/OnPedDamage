<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">float loss</syntaxhighlight>

*'''loss''': an [[int]] representing the percentage of health the ped lost.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the [[ped]] that got damaged.

==Cancel Effect==

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
local ped1 = createPed(112, 0, 0, 0) -- create our ped

function pedDamaged(loss)
    outputConsole("ped1 damaged! loss: " .. tostring(loss))
end

addEventHandler("onPedDamage", ped1, pedDamaged) -- triggered only when ped1 gets damaged
</syntaxhighlight>
