{{Client function}}
__NOTOC__
This function returns the items selected in the specified [[Element/GUI/Gridlist|grid list]].

Note that for some reason the column ID is 1 lower than it should be, for example 0 is returned but if you try and get the text for column 0 there is nothing, but column 1 has what you clicked on.
