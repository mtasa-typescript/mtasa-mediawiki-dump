{{Client function}}
{{New feature/item|3.0159|1.5.8|20675|
This function gets the Z level of the lowest roof above a point.
It is required that the point is near enough to the local player so that it's within the area where collision data is loaded.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
float getRoofPosition ( float x, float y, float z )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''x''': A [[float]]ing point number representing the X world coordinate of the point.
*'''y''': A [[float]]ing point number representing the Y world coordinate of the point.
*'''z''': A [[float]]ing point number representing the Z world coordinate of the point.

===Returns===
Returns a [[float]] with the lowest roof-level Z coord if parameters are valid, ''false'' if the point you tried to test is outside the loaded world map.

==Example==
This example starts to shake the player's camera if there is no roof over him.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
setTimer (
	function ( )
		local playerX, playerY, playerZ = getElementPosition ( localPlayer )
		local roofZ = getRoofPosition ( playerX, playerY, playerZ )
		setCameraShakeLevel ( ( roofZ ) and 0 or 255 )
	end, 100, 0
)
</syntaxhighlight>
