{{Client event}} 
This event is triggered every time before GTA renders a new frame.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
float timeSlice
</syntaxhighlight>
*'''timeSlice:''' The interval between this frame and the previous one in milliseconds (delta time).

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the client's [[root element]].

==Example==
This example makes the camera follow the player in a GTA2-like way.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function updateCamera ()
	local x, y, z = getElementPosition ( localPlayer )
	setCameraMatrix ( x, y, z + 50, x, y, z )
end
addEventHandler ( "onClientPreRender", root, updateCamera )
</syntaxhighlight>

==Warning==
This event and [[onClientRender]] will trigger whatever function it is attached to with every frame. Depending on the server's maximum FPS and what your computer might handle - you might end up triggering the function 30-60 times '''per second'''.

As a result, this event may cause severe lag and/or even crashes if not used cautiously.
