{{Client event}}
__NOTOC__ 
This event is triggered when a [[resource]] is started.  Please note that this is '''not''' triggered the same time as the serverside event [[onResourceStart]] is.  The event is triggered when any ''clientside resources'' are started.  This means it is triggered when a clientside script is initiated after a download, which includes downloading after join. So:

* If a resource is running '''before''' a player joins, the onClientResourceStart event will be triggered after they join and have downloaded that resource.
* If a resource is started '''after''' a player has joined, the player will be made to download the required files, and then the onClientResourceStart event will be triggered.

==Parameters== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource startedResource
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''startedResource''': the [[resource]] that was started.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the started resource's [[root element]].

==Example== 
This example outputs name of resource that was started.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onClientResourceStart", getRootElement( ),
    function ( startedRes )
        outputChatBox( "Resource started: " .. getResourceName( startedRes ) );
    end
);
</syntaxhighlight>
