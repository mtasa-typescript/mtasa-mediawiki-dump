<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool isKeyBound ( player thePlayer, string key, [ string keyState, function handler ] ) </syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePlayer:''' The player you're checking.
*'''key:''' The key you're checking. See [[Key names]] for a list of valid key names.

===Optional Arguments===
*'''keyState:''' Is the state of the key when it calls the function, Can be either:
**'''"up":''' when the key is released
**'''"down":''' when the key is pressed

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the key is bound, ''false'' otherwise.
