__NOTOC__ 
{{Client function}}
Creates a [[sound]] [[element]] in the GTA world and plays it immediately after creation for the local player. [[setElementPosition]] can be used to move the [[sound]] element around after it has been created. Remember to use [[setElementDimension]] after creating the sound to play it outside of dimension 0.<br />
<br />
{{Note|
*The only supported audio formats are MP3, WAV, OGG, RIFF, MOD, XM, IT and S3M.
*For performance reasons, when using playSound3D for effects that will be played lots (i.e. weapon fire), it is recommend that you convert your audio file to a one channel (mono) WAV with sample rate of 22050 Hz or less. Also consider adding a limit on how often the effect can be played e.g. once every 50ms.}}
