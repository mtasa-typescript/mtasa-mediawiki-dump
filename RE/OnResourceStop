__NOTOC__
{{Server event}}
This event is triggered when the resource is stopped. This can occur for a number of reasons:
* The ''stop'' console command was used
* The ''restart'' console command was used
* The resource was modified (the resource will automatically restart)
* Another resource stopped it using [[stopResource]].

'''Note:''' If you wish to just detect a single resource being stopped, you should attach handlers for this event to the resource's root element. You can access this using [[getResourceRootElement]]. 

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
resource stoppedResource, boolean wasDeleted
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''stoppedResource''': the [[resource]] that is being stopped.
*'''wasDeleted''': a [[boolean]] representing whether the resource folder was deleted, moved or renamed.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the root [[element]] of the resource that is being stopped.

==Example==
This example displays a message in the chatbox when a resource is stopped.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onResourceStop", root,
    function( resource )
        outputChatBox( "The resource " .. getResourceName( resource ) .. " was stopped!", root )
    end
)
</syntaxhighlight>

This example only outputs message if the stopped resource is the same resource where the eventHandler is. 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler( "onResourceStop", resourceRoot,
    function( resource )
        outputChatBox( "This resource has stopped!", root )
   end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
