{{Added feature/item|1.5.9|1.5.8|20704|This function updates GTA bone animation for a given [[element]]. Currently the [[Element/Player|Player]] and [[Element/Ped|Ped]] element types are accepted. It must be called after [[setElementBoneRotation]] for changes to take effect. It should only be called once per frame, after you are done rotating bones on that element, as it is quite heavy.}}
