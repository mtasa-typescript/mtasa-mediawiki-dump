{{Server client function}} 
This function will create a reference to the given argument.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int ref( mixed objectToReference )    
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''objectToReference :''' The Lua element, which you want to reference

===Returns===
Returns an ''int'' if the reference were successfully created. Returns ''false'' if the parameter were invalid.

==Remarks==
This function was originally created to prevent garbage-collection of specific Lua objects/elements which should persist even though no script would reference them. The storage of those references can be obtained by a call to the debug.getregistry function. Since at the moment MTA does not make use of advanced garbage-collector semantics, this function serves little purpose other than leak memory!
