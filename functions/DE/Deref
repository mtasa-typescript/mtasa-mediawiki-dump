{{Server client function}} 
This function will take a reference obtained by the [[ref]] function and returns its Lua element.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
mixed deref( int reference )    
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''reference:''' The valid reference, which you want to dereference

===Returns===
Returns ''mixed'' if the reference were valid. Returns ''false'' if the reference were invalid.

==Remarks==
This function was originally created to prevent garbage-collection of specific Lua objects/elements which should persist even though no script would reference them. The storage of those references can be obtained by a call to the debug.getregistry function. The '''ref''' and '''deref''' template can easily be remade using a locally-hidden Lua table and two such function implementations.
