__NOTOC__ 
{{Client function}}
Creates a [[sound]] [[element]] and plays it immediately after creation for the local player.
{{Added feature/item|1.6.0|1.5.9|21034|Added the feature of playing WebM files.}}
{{Note|
*The only supported audio formats are MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, RIFF, MOD, WEBM, XM, IT, S3M and PLS (e.g. Webstream).
*For performance reasons, when using playSound for effects that will be played lots (i.e. weapon fire), it is recommend that you convert your audio file to a one channel (mono) WAV with sample rate of 22050 Hz or less. Also consider adding a limit on how often the effect can be played e.g. once every 50ms.}}
==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">element playSound ( string soundPath, [ bool looped = false, bool throttled = true ] )</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[Sound]]}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''soundPath:''' [[filepath]], raw data or URL (http://, https:// or ftp://) of the sound file you want to play. ('''Note:''' Playing sound files from other resources requires the target resource to be in the running state)

===Optional Arguments=== 
{{OptionalArg}} 
*'''looped:''' a [[boolean]] representing whether the sound will be looped. To loop the sound, use ''true''. Loop is not available for streaming sounds, only for sound files.
{{New feature/item|3.0150|1.5||
*'''throttled:''' a [[boolean]] representing whether the sound will be throttled (i.e. given reduced download bandwidth). To throttle the sound, use ''true''. Sounds will be throttled per default and only for URLs.
}}

===Returns===
Returns a [[sound]] [[element]] if the sound was successfully created, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function wasted (killer, weapon, bodypart) 
	local sound = playSound("sounds/wasted.mp3") -- Play wasted.mp3 from the sounds folder
	setSoundVolume(sound, 0.5) -- Set the sound volume to 50%
end

addEventHandler("onClientPlayerWasted", localPlayer, wasted) -- Add the event handler
