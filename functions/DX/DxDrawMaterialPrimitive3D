__NOTOC__ 
{{Client function}} 
This function draws a 3D primitive shape with material applied to it in the 3D world - rendered for one frame. This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientRender]] in order to display continuously.
If image file is used, it should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring.
Power of two: 2px, 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px, 1024px...

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool dxDrawMaterialPrimitive3D ( primitiveType pType, mixed material, bool postGUI, table vertice1 [, table vertice2, ...] )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments=== 
* '''pType:''' Type of primitive to be drawn.
* '''image:''' Either a [[material]] element or a [[filepath]] of the image which is going to be drawn. (.dds images are also supported). Image files should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. Use a texture created with [[dxCreateTexture]] to '''speed up drawing'''.
* '''postGUI:''' A bool representing whether the line should be drawn on top of or behind any ingame GUI (rendered by CEGUI).
* '''vertices:''' Tables representing each primitive vertice, required amount of them is determined by primitive type.

More info on primitives may be found on [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb147291(v=vs.85).aspx this MSDN site] 
* '''pointlist:''' Renders the vertices as a collection of isolated points.
* '''linelist:''' Renders the vertices as a list of isolated straight line segments.
* '''linestrip:''' Renders the vertices as a single polyline.
* '''trianglelist:''' Renders the specified vertices as a sequence of isolated triangles. Each group of three vertices defines a separate triangle.
* '''trianglestrip:''' Renders the vertices as a triangle strip.
* '''trianglefan:''' Renders the vertices as a triangle fan.

==Vertices format==
* '''posX:''' An float representing the X position of the vertice in the GTA world.
* '''posY:''' An float representing the Y position of the vertice in the GTA world.
* '''posZ:''' An float representing the Z position of the vertice in the GTA world.
* '''color (optional):''' An integer of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue). If it's not specified, white color is used.
* '''u:''' An float representing  the relative X coordinate of the top left corner of the material which should be drawn from image
* '''v:''' An float representing  the relative Y coordinate of the top left corner of the material which should be drawn from image

===Returns===
Returns a ''true'' if the operation was successful, ''false'' otherwise.
