__NOTOC__ 
{{Client function}}
This function draws a textured 3D line between two points in the 3D world - rendered for one frame.  This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientPreRender]] in order to display continuously.

The 3D line with a large width value effectively becomes a rectangle, so it it possible to construct basic shapes such as boxes with several large width lines and the appropriate values for 'faceToward'.

3D lines are drawn at a particular place in the [[Game_Processing_Order|game processing order]], so use [[onClientPreRender]] for drawing if you are attaching them to world elements.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool dxDrawMaterialLine3D ( float startX, float startY, float startZ, float endX, float endY, float endZ, [ bool flipUV = false, ] element material, float width,
                          [ int color = white, [ bool postGUI = false, ] float faceTowardX, float faceTowardY, float faceTowardZ ] )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments=== 
* '''startX/Y/Z:''' The start position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
* '''endX/Y/Z:''' The end position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
* '''material:''' A [[material]] to draw the line with.
* '''width:''' The width/thickness of the line in GTA world units. (This is 1/75th of the width used in dxDrawLine3D)

==Optional Arguments==
{{OptionalArg}}
{{New items|3.0159|1.5.8|
* '''flipUV''': A bool representing whether a UV orientation should be flipped.
|20862}}
* '''color:''' An [[int|integer]] of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue).
{{New items|3.0156|1.5.5|
* '''postGUI''': A bool representing whether the line should be drawn on top of or behind any ingame GUI.
|11998}}
* '''faceTowardX/Y/Z:''' The position the front of the line should face towards. If this is not set, the camera position is used, so the front of the line faces toward the camera.

===Returns===
Returns a ''true'' if the operation was successful, ''false'' otherwise.
