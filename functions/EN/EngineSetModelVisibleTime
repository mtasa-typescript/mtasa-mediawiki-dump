{{Added feature/item|1.5.9|1.5.8|20704|This function changes model visibility time, this is used for example for building lights being shown after 23:00.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool engineSetModelVisibleTime ( int modelID, int timeOn, int timeOff )</syntaxhighlight> 
===Required Arguments===
*'''modelID''': The ID of the model.
*'''timeOn''': Value between 0 and 24 that states when the model should appear.
*'''timeOff''': Value between 0 and 24 that states when the model should disappear.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the change was successful, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
Make Los Santos Tower visible only between 10 and 12 AM. Please keep in mind that this function does not affect collision - the building is still there, it's just invisible:
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function init ()
    engineSetModelVisibleTime (4550, 10, 12)
end

addEventHandler ("onClientResourceStart", resourceRoot, init)
</syntaxhighlight>
