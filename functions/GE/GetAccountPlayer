{{Server function}}

This function returns the [[player]] element that is currently using a specified [[account]], i.e. is logged into it. Only one player can use an account at a time.
==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
player getAccountPlayer ( account theAccount )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[account]]:getPlayer|player|}}
===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theAccount:''' The [[account]] you wish to get the [[player]] of.

===Returns===
Returns a [[player]] element if the account is currently in use, ''false'' otherwise.

==Example== 
This example checks if the user attached to an account is a player, and if so if they're alive.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function isAccountUserAlive ( theAccount )
    local thePlayer = getAccountPlayer ( theAccount )       -- get the client attached to the account
    if ( getElementType ( thePlayer ) == "player" ) then    -- see if it really is a player (rather than a console admin for example)
        return not isPedDead(thePlayer)             -- if the player's health is greater than 0 
    end
    return false
end
</syntaxhighlight>
