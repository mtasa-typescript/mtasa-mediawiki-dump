__NOTOC__
{{Server client function}}
This function returns the ping of a specified [[player]]. The ping is the number of milliseconds that data takes to travel from the player's client to the server or vice versa. If a player is using a VPN their ping will still be returned correctly.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">int getPlayerPing ( player thePlayer )</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[player]]:getPing|ping|}}
===Required Arguments===
*'''thePlayer''': The [[player]] whose ping you want to determine.

===Returns===
Returns the ping as an [[int]], or ''false'' if the player is invalid.

==Example==
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
This example checks every players ping every 5 seconds and if it's over 500 they get kicked.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function kickPing() -- Creates a function called kickPing
	for i, player in ipairs(getElementsByType("player")) do -- Loop every player
		if (getPlayerPing(player) >= 500) then -- If their ping is over 500
			kickPlayer(player, "Ping over 500!") -- Kick them
		end
	end
end
setTimer(kickPing, 5000, 0) -- Every 5 seconds, the kickPing function is called.
</syntaxhighlight>
</section>

<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
This example checks the ping of every player entering the 'ping' command and warns him if it's over 100.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function checkPing()
        local ping = getPlayerPing(localPlayer)  -- get the ping from the source element (the player who joined)
        if (ping > 100) then                          -- if it's higher than 100...
                outputChatBox("Your ping is pretty high! Please try to lower it if possible.") -- output a message to the player
