__NOTOC__
This function gets the variant of a specified vehicle. In GTA: San Andreas some vehicles are different; for example the labelling on trucks or the contents of a pick-up truck and the varying types of a motor bike. For the default variant list see: [[Vehicle variants]].

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">int, int getVehicleVariant ( vehicle theVehicle )</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[vehicle]]:getVariant||setVehicleVariant}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theVehicle:''' The [[vehicle]] that you want to get the variant of.

==Returns==

==Example==
<section name="Client example" class="client" show="true">
This example tells the [[player]] in the [[vehicle]] what their vehicle variants are with a command named ''getvehvar'':
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function getMyVehicleVariants()
    local myVeh = getPedOccupiedVehicle(localPlayer) -- Get the vehicle that the player is in

    if myVeh then
        local variant1, variant2 = getVehicleVariant (myVeh) -- Get the vehicle variants

        outputChatBox ("This vehicle's variants are: "..tostring (variant1).." "..tostring (variant2)) -- Output the info to chatbox
    end
end
