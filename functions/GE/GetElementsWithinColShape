{{Server client function}}
__NOTOC__
This function is used to retrieve a list of all elements in a colshape, of the specified type.
{{Note|
* For legacy reasons, a colshape created on the client does not collide with elements already existing at that location until they first move.
* This function doesn't verify whether elements are in the same dimension and interior, additional checks could be implemented manually if they are needed.
}}

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
table getElementsWithinColShape ( colshape theShape [, string elemType = nil ] )
