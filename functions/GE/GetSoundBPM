{{Client function}}
{{New feature/item|3.0131|1.3.0|4145|
This function gets the beats per minute of a specific [[sound]] element.
{{Warning|This function is expensive to call and will freeze the client about 1-3 seconds. Also, trying to get the BPM from a sound directly after its creation will make the sound start only after the client freeze. You can use a [[setTimer]] to call this function after song creation so it can play normally.}}
