{{Needs_Checking|
*Things like infinite run, fire proof CJ, 150 armor have special activation flags. They need a way to be triggered on/off.

__NOTOC__
This function allows you to set the value of a specific statistic for a [[ped]]. '''Visual stats (FAT and BODY_MUSCLE) can only be used on the CJ skin''', they have no effect on other skins. When this function is used client-side, it can only be used on client-side created peds.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setPedStat ( ped thePed, int stat, float value )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''thePed''': the [[ped]] whose statistic you want to modify.
*'''stat''': the stat ID. 
{{Stats}}

*'''value''': the new value of the stat. It must be between 0 and 1000.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the statistic was changed succesfully. Returns ''false'' if an invalid player is specified, if the stat ID/value is out of acceptable range or if the FAT or BODY_MUSCLE stats are used on non-CJ players.

==Examples==
This example allows a player to type the command 'beefcake' to change his player's BODY_MUSCLE stat (#23) to the maximum value of 1000. This will result in him looking really muscular.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">function changeBodyStrength(thePlayer, commandName)
    -- Output whether the setPlayerStat was successful in changing the BODY_MUSCLE STAT     
    if setPedStat(thePlayer, 23, 1000) then
    	outputChatBox("Your player looks really muscular")
    else
        outputChatBox("Failed to make your player look muscular.")
    end
end
addCommandHandler("beefcake", changeBodyStrength)
</syntaxhighlight>

This example adds a ''/upgradeskills'' command to give the player who types it the maximum skill with every weapon and maximum health.
