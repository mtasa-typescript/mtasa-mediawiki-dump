__NOTOC__
{{Client function}}
This function controls if a ped can fall of his bike by accident - namely by banging into a wall.
{{Note | This effect is not synced for peds. When the ped falls off, he will not have exited the vehicle. To get it working you need to call it each time the ped is streamed in & each time it gets a new syncer.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setPedCanBeKnockedOffBike ( ped thePed, bool canBeKnockedOffBike )         
</syntaxhighlight> 

{{OOP||[[ped]]:setCanBeKnockedOffBike||canPedBeKnockedOffBike}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''thePed:''' the ped whose knockoffstatus is being changed
*'''canBeKnockedOffBike:''' ''true'' or ''false''

==Example== 
This example adds a console command with which the local player can toggle if he can fall off bikes.

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function changeCanBeKnockedOff()
    local canBeKnocked = canPedBeKnockedOffBike(localPlayer)
    local knockedText = canBeKnocked and "Now you can't be knocked off your bike." or "Now you can be knocked off your bike."

    setPedCanBeKnockedOffBike(localPlayer, not canBeKnocked)
    outputChatBox(knockedText)
end
addCommandHandler("knock", changeCanBeKnockedOff)
</syntaxhighlight>
