{{Server client function}}
__NOTOC__ 
This function stores [[element data]] under a certain key, attached to an element. Element data set using this is then synced with all clients and the server. The data can contain server-created elements, but you should avoid passing data that is not able to be synced such as xmlnodes, acls, aclgroups etc.

As element data is synced to all clients, it can generate a lot of network traffic and be heavy on performance. Events are much more efficient for sending data from a client to the server only, or from the server to a specific client. <br/>
Usage of element data should be discouraged where your goal can be achieved with events like above, and [[table|tables]] for storing and retrieving data.
{{Tip|A simple and efficient way to make a variable known to the server and clients is to use setElementData on the [[root]] element.}}
{{Note|See [[Script security]] for tips on preventing cheaters when using events and element data}}
{{Note|For performance reasons, never use setElementData in events that fire often (like [[onClientRender]]) without further optimization or conditions. In fact, using element data in general, can take such a toll on performance that not using it unless strictly necessary (e.g use alternatives such as storing data in tables) is recommended.}}.

{{New items|5.0157|1.5.7-9.20477|A subscription mode has been introduced for [[setElementData]] serverside. When setting data in subscription mode, only clients that are added through [[addElementDataSubscriber]] will receive the data, which is good for performance.
Note this mode only works when setting element data serverside. Setting data clientside still sends the update to all clients if 'synchronize' is set to true.

==Syntax== 

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setElementData ( element theElement, string key, var value [, bool synchronize = true ] )
</syntaxhighlight> 
{{OOP||[[element]]:setData||getElementData}}

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''theElement:''' The [[element]] you wish to attach the data to.
*'''key:''' The key you wish to store the data under. (Maximum 128 characters.) 
*'''value:''' The value you wish to store. See [[element data]] for a list of acceptable datatypes.

===Optional Arguments=== 
*'''synchronize:''' Determines whether or not the data will be synchronized with the clients(server-side variation) or server(client-side variation)

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the data was set successfully, ''false'' otherwise.

===Required Arguments===

===Optional Arguments===

**''"broadcast"'' - Synchronise to all clients (default behavior). You can also parse ''true'' for this option.
**''"local"'' - Don't synchronise. You can also parse ''false'' for this option.
**''"subscribe"'' - Only synchronise to specific clients. See [[addElementDataSubscriber]] and [[removeElementDataSubscriber]].
