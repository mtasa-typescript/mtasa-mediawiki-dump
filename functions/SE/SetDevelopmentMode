{{Server client function}}
This function is used to set the development mode. Setting development mode allows access to special commands which can assist with script debugging.

'''Client-side''' development mode commands:
* '''[[Client_Commands#showcol|showcol]]''': Enables colshapes to be viewed as a wireframe object.
* '''[[Client_Commands#showsound|showsound]]''': Enables world sound ids to be printed in the debug output window.

'''Shared''' development mode functions:
* '''[[debugSleep]]''': Sets the freeze time for the client/server.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setDevelopmentMode ( bool enable [, bool enableWeb = false ] )
</syntaxhighlight>

===Required Arguments===
*'''enable''': A boolean to indicate whether development mode is on (''true'') or off (''false'') 
{{New feature/item|3.0150|1.5||
*'''enableWeb''': A boolean to indicate whether browser debug messages will be filtered (''false'') or not (''true'')
}}

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the mode was set correctly, ''false'' otherwise.

==Requirements==
{{Requirements|1.5.4-9.11305|1.1.1-9.03355|}}

==Example== 
'''Example 1:''' This example would set the development mode of the client. Use /showcol [<0-1>] and /showsound [<0-1>] later to enable/disable respective functions. 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler("devmode",
    function()
        setDevelopmentMode(true)
    end
)
</syntaxhighlight>
It is important to note that this example has to be in a client side script. Otherwise, the execution of the command would only result in the shared dev mode that does not allow the use of '''[[Client_Commands#showcol|showcol]]''' and '''[[Client_Commands#showsound|showsound]]'''.
