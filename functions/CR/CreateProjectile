__NOTOC__
{{Client function}}
This function creates a projectile of the specified type on the specified coordinates.

{{Note|
*'''Model''' argument is not synchronized between clients. Clients differs from local player see always standard projectile model.
*'''Target''' argument can only be defined as a player or another projectile.
}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
projectile createProjectile ( element creator, int weaponType [, float posX, float posY, float posZ, float force = 1.0, element target = nil, float rotX, float rotY, float rotZ, float velX, float velY, float velZ, int model ] )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[Projectile]]}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''creator:''' The [[element]] representing creator of the projectile. In case you want the projectile to be synced for everybody creator must be the local player or his vehicle.
*'''weaponType:''' [[int]] representing the projectile weaponType (characteristics). Valid IDs are:
{{Projectiles}}

===Optional Arguments===
{{OptionalArg}}
*'''posX''', '''posY''', '''posZ''': [[float]] starting coordinates for the projectile. They are coordinates of creator by default.
*'''force''': [[float]] representing the starting force for throwable projectiles.
*'''target''': [[element]] target used for heat seeking rockets.
*'''rotX''', '''rotY''', '''rotZ''': [[float]] starting rotation for the projectile.
*'''velX''', '''velY''', '''velZ''': [[float]] starting velocity for the projectile.
*'''model''': Integer representing the projectile's model, uses default model for weaponType if not specified.

==Returns==
Returns a ''[[projectile]]'' element if [[projectile]] creation was successful. Returns ''false'' if unable to create a [[projectile]] (wrong weapon ID or projectiles limit was reached).

==Example==
This example makes a rocket minigun (minigun shooting with rockets).
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
-- This function gets triggered everytime player shoots.
function onClientPlayerWeaponFireFunc(weapon,ammo,ammoInClip,hitX,hitY,hitZ,hitElement)
	if weapon == 38 then -- if source is a local player and he uses minigun...
                x,y,z = getElementPosition(localPlayer)
		if not createProjectile(localPlayer,19,x,y,z,200) then -- then we either create a projectile...
			outputChatBox ( "Rocket minigun overheated! Give it a rest pal!", source ) -- or if projectile limit is reached we output player a chat message
		end
	end
end

-- Don't forget to add the onClientPlayerWeaponFireFunc function as a handler for onClientPlayerWeaponFire.
addEventHandler("onClientPlayerWeaponFire", localPlayer, onClientPlayerWeaponFireFunc)
</syntaxhighlight>

This example code shoots a projectile from your occupied vehicle that travels in the direction your vehicle is facing when you press vehicle_fire (left mouse button with default controls)
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">

function shootProjectile()
	local vehicle = getPedOccupiedVehicle(localPlayer)
	-- Only create projectile if we are inside a vehicle
	if(vehicle)then
		local x, y, z = getElementPosition(vehicle)
		createProjectile(vehicle, 19, x, y, z)
	end
end

bindKey("vehicle_fire", "down", shootProjectile)
</syntaxhighlight>

==Issues== 
{{Issues|
{{Issue|584|createProjectile creates one projectile for every person in the vehicle}}
{{Issue|616|Projectile rotation is set exactly opposite for creator}}
