{{Server client function}}

Reads the specified number of bytes from the given file starting at its current read/write position, and returns them as a string.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
string fileRead ( file theFile, int count )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[file]]:read}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theFile:''' A handle to the file you wish to read from. Use [[fileOpen]] to obtain this handle.
*'''count:''' The number of bytes you wish to read.

===Returns===
Returns the bytes that were read in a string. Note that this string might not contain as many bytes as you specified if an error occured, i.e. end of file.

==Example==
This example opens the file test.txt and outputs its contents to the console.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function readFile(path)
    local file = fileOpen(path) -- attempt to open the file
    if not file then
        return false -- stop function on failure
    end
    local count = fileGetSize(file) -- get file's total size
    local data = fileRead(file, count) -- read whole file
    fileClose(file) -- close the file once we're done with it
    outputConsole(data) -- output code in console
end

addCommandHandler("readfile",function(cmd,fileName) -- add command to test this function
    readFile(fileName) -- execute the function
end)
</syntaxhighlight>

[[fileOpen]] sets the read/write position to the beginning of the file.
[[fileGetSize]] gets the total size in bytes of given file.
