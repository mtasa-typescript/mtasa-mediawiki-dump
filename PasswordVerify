{{New feature/item|3.0154|1.5.4|11277|
This function verifies whether a password matches a password hash.
}}
{{Warning|It is strongly recommended to use the async version of the function (i.e. provide a callback function). Otherwise, you will experience short freezes due to the slow nature of the bcrypt algorithm}}
==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool passwordVerify ( string password, string hash [, table options, function callback ] )  
</syntaxhighlight> 

===Required Arguments=== 
*'''password:''' The password to check.
*'''hash:''' A supported hash (see [[passwordHash]]). <span style="color:red">Note that only the prefix ''$2y$'' is supported for type bcrypt (older prefixes can cause security issues).</span>

===Optional Arguments===
{{New feature/item|3.0156|1.5.6||
*'''options:''' advanced options
**'''insecureBcrypt:''' If set to ''true'', you can use the ''$2a$'' prefix for bcrypt hashes as well. '''It is strongly not recommended to use it though, because the underlying implementation has a bug that leads to such hashes being relatively easy to crack.''' This bug was fixed for ''$2y$''.
}}
{{New feature/item|3.0154|1.5.4|11281|
*'''callback:''' providing a callback will run this function asynchronously, the arguments to the callback are the same as the returned values below.
}}

===Returns===
Returns true if the password matches the hash. Returns false if the password does not match, or if an unknown hash was passed. If a callback was provided, the aforementioned values are arguments to the callback, and this function will always return ''true''.

==Example==
See [[passwordHash]] example.
