{{Needs Checking|Cancellation of event has no effect. detachTrailerFromVehicle in the event doesn't work either, 50 ms timer is effective.}}
This event is triggered when a trailer is attached to a truck or when a tow truck hooks on to a vehicle.

==Parameters==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
vehicle theTruck
</syntaxhighlight> 

*'''theTruck''': the truck [[vehicle]] that got attached to this trailer.

==Source==
The [[event system#Event source|source]] of this event is the trailer [[vehicle]] that the truck got attached to.

<!-- Only include this section below if cancelling the event has any effect. If you don't know if it does, ask a dev! -->
==Cancel effect==
{{Warning|Doesn't appear to work.}}
If this event is [[Event system#Canceling|canceled]], the trailer will detach from the truck again.

==Example== 
<!-- Explain what the example is in a single sentance -->
This example removes a trailer from the truck it is attached to. Good if you do not want people attaching trailers to vehicles
<!-- Add the code below, an emphasis should be on making it clear, not optimized. You could provide two versions if you wish, one clear and well commented, the other optimized -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function detachTrailer(theTruck)
    --detachTrailerFromVehicle(theTruck, source) --detach the newly attached trailer
    -- Immediate detatchment of the trailer through cancel event or this method doesn't seem to work so requires a timer:
    setTimer(detachTrailer2, 50, 1, theTruck, source)
end
addEventHandler("onTrailerAttach", getRootElement(), detachTrailer)

function detachTrailer2(theTruck, trailer)
    if (isElement(theTruck) and isElement(trailer)) then
        detachTrailerFromVehicle(theTruck, trailer)
    end
end
