{{Server client function}}

This function is for getting the details of a running timer.

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
int, int, int getTimerDetails ( timer theTimer )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[timer]]:getDetails||}}
===Required Arguments===
*'''theTimer:''' A timer element.

===Returns===
* Integer one represents the time left in miliseconds (1000th of a second) of the current time left in the loop.
* Integer two represents the amount of times the timer has left to execute.
* Integer three represents the time interval of timer.

* Returns false if the timer doesn't exist or stopped running. Also, debugscript will say "Bad Argument @ 'getTimerDetails'". To prevent this, you can check if the timer exists with [[isTimer]]().

==Example==
This example creates a 1 second (1000 ms) timer that will run 10 times, and you can see the timer details by using the command: timerdetails.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
theTimer = setTimer(function() end, 1000, 10) -- A timer that does nothing.

function timerDetails()
	local remaining, executesRemaining, timeInterval = getTimerDetails(theTimer) -- Get the timers details
	if (remaining and executesRemaining and timeInterval) then
		outputChatBox("Time remaining this second: "..remaining.." Executes remaining: "..executesRemaining.." Time interval: "..timeInterval)
	else
		outputChatBox("Timer no longer exists")
	end
end
addCommandHandler("timerdetails", timerDetails)
