        return false
    end
    -- look up the player to be slapped
    local targetPlayer = getPlayerFromName ( targetPlayerName )
    -- if there's a player with such name,
    if targetPlayer then
        -- subtract 20 from his health
        setElementHealth ( targetPlayer, getElementHealth(targetPlayer) - 20 )
    else
        -- otherwise, output an error message
        outputChatBox ( "There is no player named " .. targetPlayerName .. "!", sourcePlayer )
