{{New feature/item|3.0158|1.5.7|19626|Function also added client-side.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setPedArmor ( ped thePed, float armor )
</syntaxhighlight>
[[File:Armor.png|thumb|Armor bar on the hud]]
{{OOP||[[ped]]:setArmor|armor|getPedArmor}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''thePed''': the [[ped]] whose armor you want to modify.
*'''armor''': the amount of armor you want to set on the ped. Valid values are from 0 to 100.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the armor was changed succesfully. Returns ''false'' if an invalid ped was specified, or the armor value specified is out of acceptable range.

==Example==
This example removes the armor of a player.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function armor (player, command)
   if command == "addarmor" then 
      setPedArmor ( player, 100 )    -- Set player's armor to 100 when he types the command 'addarmor'
   elseif command == "removearmor" then 
      setPedArmor ( player, 0 )      -- Set player's armor to 0 when he types the command 'removearmor'
   end 
end
addCommandHandler ("addarmor", armor)
addCommandHandler ("removearmor", armor)

</syntaxhighlight>

In this, adds an amount of armor that the player defined in command 'addarmor'.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function givePlayerArmor( player, command, amount )
   if getPedArmor(player) == 100 then
      outputChatBox("Your armor already is complete!", player, 220, 0, 0 ) -- Inform the player if your armor already is complete.
      return
   end

   if amount and tonumber(amount) >= 1 or tonumber(amount) <= 100 then -- If amount is between 1 and 100.
      setPedArmor(player, tonumber(amount))    -- Set amount armor that player chosen on the command.
   else
      outputChatBox( "Syntax: /addarmor [armor-amount] the amount should be between 1 and 100", player, 220, 0, 0 ) -- Inform the player if 'amount' argument is missing.
   end
end
addCommandHandler( "addarmor", givePlayerArmor )
</syntaxhighlight>
