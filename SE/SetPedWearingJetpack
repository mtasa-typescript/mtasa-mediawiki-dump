This function is used to give or take a jetpack from a ped, it won't work if the ped is in a vehicle.

As such, you should either expect it to fail sometimes, or repeatedly try to give a jetpack every second or so until [[isPedWearingJetpack]] returns true. Alternatively, you can force the ped into a 'safe' position (e.g. standing on the ground) before giving the jetpack, or use a [[pickup]] to handle it.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool setPedWearingJetpack ( ped thePed, bool state )</syntaxhighlight>
