{{Client function}}
{{New feature/item|3.0158|1.5.7|20642|This function sets the scale of all the wheels of a [[vehicle]]. The wheel scale multiplies the visible height and length (but not width) of all the wheels in a vehicle, without affecting their collisions or the handling, similarly to [[setVehicleComponentScale]]. The wheel scale is applied after the [[setVehicleModelWheelSize|model wheel size]].}}
{{Note|Installing or removing a wheel upgrade from a vehicle resets the wheel scale to the default value.}}
{{Tip|The default value for vehicles without wheel upgrades is 1, which renders the wheels in the model as usual. On the other hand, the default value for vehicles with a wheel upgrade is the [[setVehicleModelWheelSize|size of the wheels in the front axle]] of the vehicle model.}}

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setVehicleWheelScale ( vehicle theVehicle, float wheelScale )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[vehicle]]:setWheelScale|wheelScale|getVehicleWheelScale}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theVehicle''': The [[vehicle]] whose wheel scale you wish to modify.
*'''wheelScale''': The wheel scale value to set.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if the wheel scale has been set successfully, or an error if some parameter is invalid.

==Example==
[[File:Wheel scale example preview.png|thumb|Preview of the results of invoking the ''shrinkwheels'' command]]
This example adds a ''shrinkwheels'' command that reduces the wheel scale of a vehicle in half each time it is invoked.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addCommandHandler("shrinkwheels", function()
    local veh = getPedOccupiedVehicle(localPlayer)
    if veh then
        local newScale = getVehicleWheelScale(veh) * 0.5
        setVehicleWheelScale(veh, newScale)
        outputChatBox("Vehicle wheel scale set to " .. newScale .. ".", 0, 255, 0)
    else
        outputChatBox("You must be in a vehicle to use this command.", 255, 0, 0)
    end
end)
