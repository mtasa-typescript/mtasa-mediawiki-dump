{{Server client function}}
__NOTOC__
This function allows you to set the [[dimension]] of any element. The dimension determines what/who the element is visible to.

==Syntax==
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
bool setElementDimension ( element theElement, int dimension )
</syntaxhighlight>
{{OOP||[[element]]:setDimension|dimension|getElementDimension}}

===Required Arguments===
*'''theElement:''' The element in which you'd like to set the dimension of.
*'''dimension:''' An integer representing the dimension ID. {{New feature/item|3.0154|1.5.3|11199|You can also use '''-1''' to make the element visible in all dimensions (only valid to objects).}} Valid values are 0 to 65535.

===Returns===
Returns ''true'' if '''theElement''' and '''dimension''' are valid, ''false'' otherwise.
Also returns false if '''theElement''' is a player and it's not alive.

==Example==
<section name="Server" class="server" show="true">
In this example the player's dimension is set to ID 1 when they enter a vehicle, and set back to dimension 0 when they exit the vehicle.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function onPlayerEnterVehicle ( theVehicle, seat, jacked )
      if ( getElementDimension ( source ) == 0 ) then    -- if the player is in dimension 0
            setElementDimension ( source, 1 )            -- set his dimension to 1
            setElementDimension ( theVehicle, 1 )        -- set his vehicle's dimension to 1 as well
      end
end
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerVehicleEnter", root, onPlayerEnterVehicle )

function onPlayerExitVehicle ( theVehicle, seat, jacker )
      if ( getElementDimension ( source ) == 1 ) then    -- if the player is in dimension 1
            setElementDimension ( source, 0 )            -- set his dimension back to 0
            setElementDimension ( theVehicle, 0 )        -- set his vehicle's dimension back to 0 as well
      end
end
