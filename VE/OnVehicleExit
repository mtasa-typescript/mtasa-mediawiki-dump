==Example== 
This example adds a 'moto' helmet to a player when he gets on a nrg bike, and removes it when he gets off.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function addHelmetOnEnter ( thePlayer, seat, jacked )
    if ( getElementModel ( source ) == 522 ) then -- if its a nrg
        addPedClothes ( thePlayer, "moto", "moto", 16 ) -- add the helmet
    end
end
addEventHandler ( "onVehicleEnter", getRootElement(), addHelmetOnEnter )

function removeHelmetOnExit ( thePlayer, seat, jacked )
    if ( getElementModel ( source ) == 522 ) then -- if its a nrg
        removePedClothes ( thePlayer, 16 ) -- remove the helmet
    end
end
addEventHandler ( "onVehicleExit", getRootElement(), removeHelmetOnExit )
</syntaxhighlight>


==Example 2==

<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
addEventHandler ( "onPlayerVehicleExit", getRootElement(), function(theVehicle, leftSeat, jackerPlayer)
    if leftSeat == 0 and not jackerPlayer then
       setVehicleEngineState( theVehicle, false)
    end
end)
