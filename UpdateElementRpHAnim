{{New feature/item|3.0160|1.5.8|20704|This function updates GTA bone animation for a given [[element]]. Currently the following element types are accepted:
* [[Element/Player|Player]]
* [[Element/Ped|Ped]]
This function must be called after [[setElementBoneRotation]] for changes to take effect. It should only be called once per frame, after you are done rotating bones on that element, as it is quite heavy.
