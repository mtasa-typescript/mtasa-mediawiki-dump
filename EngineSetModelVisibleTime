{{Client function}}
{{New feature/item|3.0159|1.5.8|20416|This function changes model visibility time, this is used for example for building lights being shown after 23:00.}}

==Syntax== 
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">bool engineSetModelVisibleTime( int modelID, int timeOn, int timeOff )</syntaxhighlight> 
===Required Arguments===
*'''modelID''': ID of the model
*'''timeOn''': value between 23 and 0 that states when the model should appear
*'''timeOff''': value between 23 and 0 that states when the model should disappear

===Returns===
Returns '''true''' if the change was successful, '''false''' otherwise.

==Example== 
<section name="Client" class="client" show="true">
Make Los Santos Tower visible only between 10 and 12 AM. Please keep in mind that this function does not affect collision - the building is still there, it's just invisible.
<syntaxhighlight lang="lua">
function init()
	engineSetModelVisibleTime(4550, 10, 12)
end
addEventHandler("onClientResourceStart", resourceRoot, init)
</syntaxhighlight>
